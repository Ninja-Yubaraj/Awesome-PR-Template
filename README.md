- Personal project someone wanna contribute to 
- A business website
- Your Organisation's next app which is **\*gonna change the face of the Earth in the next years\*.**
- A search engine which is basically **spying on its customers.**
- A social-media service which is **selling the data of its users,**
- The source code for a giant robot which is made **\*to rule over the Earth and keep moon as a hostage.\***
- Or maybe the binary files for your coffee machine.
